# Zystal

Zystal is a lightweight Tauri/Electron alternative built with Zig.

It allows you to build desktop apps with web tech on the frontend and Zig on the backend, while using the system webview implementation without bundling Chromium for each user.

Right now, the result binary in -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall is 717kb in size with example frontend 🤪
